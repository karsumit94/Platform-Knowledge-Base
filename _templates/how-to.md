title: [Character Limit: 255, Recommendation is to have <= 75 characters for a title as this can impact indexing by search engines like Google, Bing, etc. The article title should be a combination of the main problem statement and if applicable, the key environment statement. Also determines the title in the table of contents.]
description: [Character Limit: 255, Recommended length: <= 155 characters. The description is what search engines usually show in the search results. Typically, search engines truncate the description after the 155th character. The description should be a brief overview of the how-to article. It should exclude unnecessary phrases like "This article contains ..."]
type: how-to
page_title: [Text that will populate the HTML fileâ€™s head:title attribute. It is good to use different than the title name here, in order to cover more key words and be more discoverable via searches.]
slug: [Unique identifier of the article. Used for cross-referencing. Ex: how-to-write-an-essay-nativescript]

teampulseid: [A number, representing the TeamPulse ID of the issue\question. Leave this blank if the issue\question doesn't exist as an item in TeamPulse]
ticketid: [A number, representing the ticket ID associated with this issue\question. The field can contain more than one ticket IDs (e.g. several clients have reported it). In such cases, we separate the ticket IDs with commas. Leave this blank if the issue\question is not related to a support case]
