## Environment
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Service</td>
		<td>{{site.ab-s}} ({{site.ab}})</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>{{site.ab-s}} ({{site.ab}}) clients</td>

	</tr>
</table>

## Description

{{site.ab}} stores logs that you can examine to diagnose problems that occur at run-time in the {{site.ab}} extension for Visual Studio and the Windows client.

## Solution

You can access the logs stored by the extension for Visual Studio and the classic Windows Desktop client from the `%localappdata%\Telerik\BlackDragon\Logs` directory.

You can archive and share these logs with the {{site.tp}} support personnel when you report a problem related to the {{site.ab}} Windows clients.
