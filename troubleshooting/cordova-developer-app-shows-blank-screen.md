## Environment
<table>

## Description
After installing the latest {{site.ab-app}} version, when trying to open your app in it, you can only see a blank screen. When you select an app to open or scan a QR code in the {{site.tp-app}}, the {{site.ab-app}} runs but it shows a blank screen. 

## Cause
The cause of the issue is still under investigation.

## Solution
To fix this, you need to uninstall both the {{site.tp-app}} and {{site.ab-app}} and then install them again from the App Store.
